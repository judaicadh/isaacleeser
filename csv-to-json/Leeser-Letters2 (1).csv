LSDCBx2FF1_37,Letter advocating for agricultural training in Palestine,Palestine|Agriculture|Philanthropy,Palestine,Palestine,"Letter from an anonymous writer in New York City to Rabbi Isaac Leeser in Philadelphia, dated April 23, 1854. The writer forwards a letter received from his brother concerning favorable political and social prospects in Palestine for agricultural pursuits.  The writer urges Leeser to influence those controlling funds for Palestine to use a portion for teaching agriculture to the poor, referencing Leeser's proposal in the February issue of *The Occident*. The writer emphasizes the advantages of aiding brethren to become self-sufficient rather than supporting them in idleness, and expresses hope that Leeser will continue his efforts to achieve this goal. The letter mentions the potential role of farmers and mechanics in providing agricultural instruction and the continued provision of financial allowances by the Rabbis.
